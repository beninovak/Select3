// 1. if maxSelectedOptions is smaller than current selected options, maxSelectedOptions will be raised to that number
// 2. AJAX search - function should construct <option> elements and add them to <select> element as well -- why even do this??? Let user do their own AJAX and use .appendOptions
// 3. Keyboard support - check <select> element controls and copy them
// 4. Events - on close, on open, (on select, on deselect => on change), on maxed options, on init, on destroy, on clear all options, maybe on select/unselect option, maybe also before select/clear/destroy etc...?
// 5. Check if you could append array of options to an empty select with no options
// 6. Dynamic option creation
// 7. Clear all options method

8. Maybe add 'destroying' and 'initing' events?...Why tho
9. Add a way to disabled a certain option...would potentially need to do more than just adding "disabled" attribute to <option> and data-disabled to select3 option???
