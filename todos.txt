// 1. if maxSelectedOptions is smaller than current selected options, maxSelectedOptions will be raised to that number
// 2. AJAX search - function should construct <option> elements and add them to <select> element as well -- why even do this??? Let user do their own AJAX and use .appendOptions
// 3. Keyboard support - check <select> element controls and copy them
4. Events - on close, on open, on select, on deselect, on options cap hit ( max options selected ), on ajaxSearch, on init, on destroy ( if destroy function will exist )
// 5. Check if you could append array of options to an empty select with no options
6. Dynamic option creation
